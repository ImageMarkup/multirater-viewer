This is a multirater visualzization app I am (badly) writing in Flask

This includes code to pull data from the ISIC archive, and other helper functions

to load the proper environment, please use anaconda python

once it's installed, you can do

conda create --name Flask_MultiRater -f requirements.txt

##Thsi will load all the required dependncies

Once this is done, run

source activate Flask_MultiRater
